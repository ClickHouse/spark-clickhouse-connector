Overview
===

Spark ClickHouse Connector is a high performance connector build on top of Spark DataSource V2 and
ClickHouse gRPC protocol.

## Requirements

1. Basic knowledge of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) and [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/).
2. An available ClickHouse single node or cluster, and ClickHouse version should at least [v21.1.2.15-stable](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#clickhouse-release-v211215-stable-2021-01-18),
   because Spark communicates with ClickHouse through the gRPC protocol.
3. An available Spark cluster, and Spark version should be 3.2 or 3.3, because we need the interfaces of Spark DataSource V2
   added in 3.2.0 or 3.3.0.
4. Make sure your network policy satisfies the following requirements, both driver and executor of Spark need to access 
   ClickHouse gRPC port. If you are using it to access ClickHouse cluster, ensure the connectivity between driver and
   executor of Spark and each node of ClickHouse cluster.

## Notes

1. Integration tests based on Java 8&11, Scala 2.12&2.13, Spark 3.2.1&3.3.0 and ClickHouse v22.3.3.44-lts, with both single
   ClickHouse instance and ClickHouse cluster.
