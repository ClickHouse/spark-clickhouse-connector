===

!!! danger "Notice"

    Public Release means deploying to Maven Central. Only core team members are granted to deploy into Public Repository.

!!! note

    Most of the steps for a public release are done by the GitHub workflow.

## Snapshot Release

The daily snapshot release is managed by [Publish Snapshot](https://github.com/ClickHouse/spark-clickhouse-connector/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-snapshot.yml)
workflow, it is scheduled to be deployed at midnight every day.


## Feature Release

1. Cut new branch from main branch, e.g. `branch-0.3`;
2. Update version in `version.txt` and `docker/.env-dev`, e.g. from `0.3.0-SNAPSHOT` to `0.3.0`;
3. Create new tag, e.g. `v0.3.0`, it will trigger the [Publish Release](https://github.com/ClickHouse/spark-clickhouse-connector/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-release.yml)
   workflow; 
4. Verify, close, and release in [Sonatype Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories)

6. Update version in `version.txt` and `docker/.env-dev`, e.g. from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1-SNAPSHOT`;
7. Update version on main branch in `version.txt` and `docker/.env-dev`, e.g. from `0.3.0-SNAPSHOT` to `0.4.0-SNAPSHOT`;
