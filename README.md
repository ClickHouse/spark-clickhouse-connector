Build on Apache Spark DataSourceV2 API.

## Usage

See the [documentation](https://housepower.github.io/spark-clickhouse-connector/) for how to use this connector.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or 11
- Scala 2.12 or 2.13
- Apache Spark 3.2 or 3.3 
- ClickHouse 21.1.2.15 or newer

Notes:
1. Currently, only support gRPC protocol, and ClickHouse support gRPC since
   [v21.1.2.15-stable](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#clickhouse-release-v211215-stable-2021-01-18),
   but we only do test on v22.3.3.44-lts.

## Build

Build w/o test

`./gradlew clean build -x test`

## Test

The project leverage [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
to do integration tests, you should install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
before running test, and check more details on [Testcontainers document](https://www.testcontainers.org/) if you'd
like to run test with remote Docker daemon.

Run all test

`./gradlew clean test`

Run all test w/ Spark 3.2 and Scala 2.13

`./gradlew clean test -Dspark_binary_versions=3.2 -Dscala_binary_version=2.13`

Run single test

`./gradlew test --tests=ConvertDistToLocalWriteSuite`

### ARM Platform

For developers/users who use ARM platform, e.g. [Apple Silicon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon) chips,
[Kunpeng](https://www.hikunpeng.com/) chips, you may not run integrations test in local directly, because 
[ClickHouse does not provide gRPC support in official ARM image](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36754).

As a workaround, you can set the environment variable `CLICKHOUSE_IMAGE` to use a custom image which support gRPC
on ARM platform for testing.

```
export CLICKHOUSE_IMAGE=pan3793/clickhouse-server:22.5.1-alpine-arm-grpc
./gradlew clean test
```
