Build on Apache Spark DataSourceV2 API.

![Overview](docs/imgs/scc_overview.drawio.png)

## Usage

See the [documentation](https://housepower.github.io/spark-clickhouse-connector/) for how to use this connector.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or 11
- Scala 2.12 or 2.13
- Apache Spark 3.2 or 3.3

Notes:
1. As of 0.5.0, this connector switches from ClickHouse raw gRPC Client to 
   [ClickHouse Official Java Client](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-jdbc), which brings HTTP protocol support,
   extending the range of supported versions of ClickHouse Server.

2. Due to lack of developer resources, the project is currently only focusing on Spark 3.3 support, which means you
   may find something it documents but does not work in Spark 3.2, or has significantly worse performance comparing
   to Spark 3.3. When you come into such a situation, send a PR to backport the patch from Spark 3.3 module to
   Spark 3.2 is first choice. Also, open an issue to request a backport is fine, I will check the issue list and
   fix some of important ones if I have time.

## Build

Build w/o test

`./gradlew clean build -x test`

## Test

The project leverage [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
to do integration tests, you should install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
before running test, and check more details on [Testcontainers document](https://www.testcontainers.org/) if you'd
like to run test with remote Docker daemon.

Run all test

`./gradlew clean test`

Run all test w/ Spark 3.2 and Scala 2.13

`./gradlew clean test -Dspark_binary_version=3.2 -Dscala_binary_version=2.13`

Run single test

`./gradlew test --tests=ConvertDistToLocalWriteSuite`

### ARM Platform

For developers/users who use ARM platform, e.g. [Apple Silicon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon)
chips, [Kunpeng](https://www.hikunpeng.com/) chips, you may not able to run TPC-DS integrations test using gRPC in local directly,
because [ClickHouse does not provide gRPC support in official ARM image](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36754).

As a workaround, you can set the environment variable `CLICKHOUSE_IMAGE` to use a custom image which supports gRPC
on ARM platform for testing.

```
export CLICKHOUSE_IMAGE=pan3793/clickhouse-server:22.5.1-alpine-arm-grpc
./gradlew clean test
```
